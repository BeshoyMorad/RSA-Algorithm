# RSA Encryption Algorithm

### About 
RSA (Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data
transmission.

Here you can find:
- A way to **encrypt/decrypt** text using the RSA algorithm
- Implement for another program that tries to break RSA and get the correct private key.
- Analysis for different key sizes (number of bits of n) and how it affects the speed of
encryption/decryption and the time of algorithm breaking.

### How to run ðŸš€

- Open a terminal and type ```python app.py server```
- Open another terminal and type ```python app.py client```
- Enter your username in both terminals and start chatting
